Gazebo Simulation support on Windows

Overview

The Gazebo Simulator (currently called Ignition) provides the ability to Test robot behavior in an environment that includes real-world physics emulation of properties like cravity, momentum, inertia, collisions etc. In past years this test bed was initially supported by First but was dropped more recently, most probably because it was only fully provided on Linux platforms which were difficult to come by for most FRC teams.
