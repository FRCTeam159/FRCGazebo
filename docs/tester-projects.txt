Programming using simulation for software testers

Setup
    1) open visual studio from desktop or taskbar icon
    3) open a terminal and "cd" to target project directory (see Explore and Projects below)

Running a simulation
    1) in a terminal showing target project directory enter "gzstart" to start simulation
      - should see 3 windows appear:
        o gazebo (displays a robot and other items)
        o Smartdashboard
        o simulated driver station (simDS)
    2) to test-drive a robot in teleop mode, select "teleoperated" from sim driver station and use game controller to move the robot
    3) to reset to the starting configuration press disable in DS and then the "Reset" checkbox in Smartdashboard
    4) to test auto, first reset scene and then press "Autonomous" in simDS
    5) to end the simulation enter "gzstop" in the terminal

Explore (run all simulations from previous games)
   1) in vscode open a file called ~/.bashrc
   2) follow directions starting at line 20 of this file

Projects
Project 1 (tankBot)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory-containing-FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Projects
    2) rename project e.g. TankBot
    3) modify project to include a drivetrain[tank] subsystem and a teleop command
    4) add a simple autonomous command (e.g. drive for time, turn in place)
    5) add a programmed path auto command (using Trajectory)

Project 2 (swervebot)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory-containing-FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Projects
    2) rename project e.g. SwerveBot
    3) modify project to include a drivetrain[swerve] subsystem and a teleop command
    4) add a simple autonomous command (e.g. drive for distance, turn in place)
    5) add a programmed path auto command (using Trajectory)
    
Project 3 (vision tests)
    1) for either of the previous robots add a GRIP vision tageting subsystem and display detected targets on dashboard
    2) add a front/back switchable camera subsystem

Project 4 (robot with manipulator)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory containing FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Robots
    2) rename project as approprate e.g. ElevatorBot
    3) choose a robot from a previous game (2016...2023 in FRCGazebo/SimBots)
       - copy appropriate world and models files from SimBot to current project
    4) write a simple subsystem to control all the features os the manipulator
       - map controls to game controller
    5) write an autonomous command that uses the manipulator to do something
