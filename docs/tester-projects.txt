Dummy starter robot project for programming using simulation for software testers
Problems
Project 1 (tankBot)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory containing FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Robots
    2) rename project e.g. TankBot
    3) modify project to include a drivetrain[tank] subsystem and a teleop command
    4) add a simple autonomous command (e.g. drive for time, turn in place)
    5) add a programmed path auto command (using Trajectory)
Project 2 (swervebot)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory containing FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Robots
    2) rename project e.g. SwerveBot
    3) modify project to include a drivetrain[swerve] subsystem and a teleop command
    4) add a simple autonomous command (e.g. drive for distance, turn in place)
    5) add a programmed path auto command (using Trajectory)
Project 3 (vision tests)
    1) for either of the previous robots add a GRIP vision tageting subsystem and display detected targets on dashboard
    2) add a front/back switchable camera subsystem
Project 4 (robot with manipulator)
    1) copy FRCGazebo/gzsim/tests/StarterRobot to: <direcory containing FRCGazebo>/Testers/[tester_name]/Robots
    2) rename project as approprate e.g. ElevatorBot
    3) choose a robot from a previous game (2016...2023 in FRCGazebo/SimBots)
       - copy appropriate world and models files from SimBot to current project
    4) write a simple subsystem to control all the features os the manipulator
       - map controls to game controller
    5) write an autonomous command that uses the manipulator to do something
