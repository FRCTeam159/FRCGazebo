Runtime problems
1) GzProgram.exe generates "library not found" errors when run (? or ntcore.dll)
likely cause: anaconda base shell not activated in gitbash results in missing dependent libraries
symptom: (base) missing in command shell
work-around: added the folowing to the top of ~/.bashrc
  source ${HOME}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  conda activate base
possible reasons for failure
 - "conda init bash" fails with an error when run from comand shell
 - not sure why this error started occuring (might be a newer version of gitbash was installed ?)
2) Smartdashboard fails to display StringChooser (intermittantly)
likely cause : classes ITable and ITableListener used in project have been deprecated
work-around: can use shuffleboard as an alternative (problem doesn't happen here)
better: wait for wpi to fix problem or build custom tool after fixing locally
