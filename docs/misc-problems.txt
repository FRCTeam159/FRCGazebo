Runtime problems
1) GzProgram.exe generates "library not found" errors when run (? or ntcore.dll)
  likely cause: anaconda base shell not activated in gitbash results in missing dependent libraries
  symptom: (base) missing in command shell
  work-around: added the folowing to the top of ~/.bashrc
    source ${HOME}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base
  possible reasons for failure
    - "conda init bash" fails with an error when run from comand shell
    - not sure why this error started occuring (might be a newer version of gitbash was installed ?)
2) Smartdashboard fails to display StringChooser (intermittantly)
  likely cause : classes ITable and ITableListener used in project have been deprecated
  work-around: can use shuffleboard as an alternative (problem doesn't happen here)
  update: problem traced to my version - had to move earlier where Frame is envoked in SmartDashboard.java
3) vc startup or java "clean workspace" fails with "too many error - wont be restarted" message
  leaves indexer incomplete (cant goto definition etc)
  work-around: delete all folders in : C:\Users\Public\wpilib\2023\vscode\data\user-data\User\workspaceStorage
               and restart vs code
