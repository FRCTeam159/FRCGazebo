Runtime problems
1) GzProgram.exe generates "library not found" errors when run (? or ntcore.dll)
  likely cause: anaconda base shell not activated in gitbash results in missing dependent libraries
  symptom: (base) missing in command shell
  work-around: added the folowing to the top of ~/.bashrc
    source ${HOME}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base
  possible reasons for failure
    - "conda init bash" fails with an error when run from comand shell
    - not sure why this error started occuring (might be a newer version of gitbash was installed ?)
2) Smartdashboard fails to display StringChooser (intermittantly)
  likely cause : classes ITable and ITableListener used in project have been deprecated
  work-around: can use shuffleboard as an alternative (problem doesn't happen here)
  update: problem traced to my version - had to move earlier where Frame is envoked in SmartDashboard.java
3) vc startup or java "clean workspace" fails with "too many error - wont be restarted" message
  leaves indexer incomplete (cant goto definition etc)
  work-around: delete all folders in : C:\Users\Public\wpilib\2023\vscode\data\user-data\User\workspaceStorage
               and restart vs code
4) For some reason FRCGazebo binaries (plugin .dlls and GZProgram.exe) don't always work when run on different systems
   than the one they were originally built for: get 'not found' errors when loading dlls from start_gazebo etc.
   - had a case where execs were built on win11 desktop and pushed to repo - then win10 laptop failed to run
   - another case where win11 projects failed to work using execs built on another (win11?) laptop 
   - may be some kind of caching problem because sometimes things seem to work (??)
   - workaround: add *.dll and *.exe to .gitignore (will need to force-settigsadd them if those execs need to be changed)
5) On Dell precision M6800 laptops scene is unusually dark
   workaround: disable shadows by adding the following to each world file (after <world> token):
   <scene><shadows>0</shadows></scene>
   - note: never see any shadows in simulation even on other systems without the workaround (maybe shadows are broken)
6) after several days of sucessful testing on 2 dell precision laptops the graphics performance on both became very poor
   - e.g. gazebo realtime factor <0.1 (should be ~0.8)
   - other programs also appear to have suffered degraded performance (e.g. pressing start button taks a few seconds to popup menu)
   - installing windows update and new graphics drivers didn't fix problem
   problem fixed (itself ?) did the following:
   - enabled 3d in display options (somehow was turned off)
   - used function key (fn-f8) to direct all graphics to external monitor (otherwize lots of flickering)
