PlotServer - A Windows Utility to display plots (usually generated in commands/PlotPath)
Roborio - to windows plots
- from laptop run start_plot_server in a terminal (located in FRCGazebo/bin)
  note: need to have FRCGazebo/bin in Windows PATH
Simulations 
- add an instance of PlotServer in RobotContainer (e.g. m_plotserver =new PlotServer())
- in RobotInit include "m_plotserver.run" in RobotInit()
  note: Also need to modify biuild.gradle to include FRCGazebo source as a relative path e.g. from SimBots add:
  sourceSets {
    main {
        java{
            srcDirs '../../gzsim/java'
        }
    }
  - In this situation PlotServer is running as a thread in the (Windows sim) application so don't need to envoke 
    "start_plot_server" in a separate terminal
}
Building
in a terminal in FRCGazebo/gzsim/PlotServer enter :
- gradlew shadowJar
  note: can also run by entering > gradlew runShadow 
Exporting for RoboRio plots
- in FRCGazebo/gzsim/PlotServer
  > cp build/install/PlotServer-shadow/lib/TestApplication-win64.jar $GAZEBO_BIN/PlotServer.jar
